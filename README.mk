Assignment 1 - Code Refactor 

For this assignment we were supposed to clean up an existing site and make it conform to accessibility standards.

To this end I:
* Added Alt tags to images
* Added semantic markup language to differentiate sections
* Consolidated inefficient CSS
* Made content larger for easier readabilty
* Cleaned up appearance on page so article and aside are equal heights
* Added button at bottom to return to the top
* Identified Benefits section with header tag.
